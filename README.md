<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![screencapture-127-0-0-1-5501-2021-10-14-16_20_26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63668672/137325603-26533686-071a-45a0-8239-2dec3ef6daab.png)

We are going for it! First project for the course, the task is simple enough. Build a website using everything we have learned in this unit. Try to take advantaje of the homework assignments that you have done yourself in the past to be able to apply some functionality for it.

Here are the requirements:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* You should implement DRY principles for the rest of your life :smile:
* As a user you have to be able to navigate some information and display it.
* There needs to be some wireframing.
* There needs to be a readme.
* There needs to be a plan before hand that needs to be aproved by your instructor.
* The use of Bootstrap is optional.
* You have to use an API out of the options we give to fetch some information from the JSON.
* It needs to be responsive.

BONUS
* CRUD.
